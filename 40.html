<BR>For Katoosh's 40:

<BR>Katoooosh is forty
<BR>And she is so sporty

<BR>She is still a few more years before she goes to the Atria
<BR>But hers might be in Naherya

<BR>Katooosh now entering her 5th decade
<BR>But from S&P and Moody's she only gets an upgrade

<BR>And her teeth are so good the dentist says she has no Plauque
<BR>To which I want to say "To whom did you give it and when did you get it back"

<BR>And coffee she sends me every weekend to make because it says Heb-rew
<BR>And to Israel at age 39 year she flew

<BR>And Katooosh likes those play on words
<BR>Just as much as she likes the kurds

<BR>A surprise party was held for Katooosh at resurant Blue
<BR>It was one that Ari and Jeremy help to threw

<BR>This is after we told her the party will be at 3:00 o'clock
<BR>And when there was no party at 3:00 she thought we were a shmock

<BR>And finally Katooosh has an iphone
<BR>And seppa has her bone

<BR>And Katoosh now makes her hair straight
<BR>While on her iphone she listens to podcasts from Slate

<BR>And I so much love my wife who is now the big four ooh
<BR>All the way from her head down to her toe


<BR>Love,
<BR>XOXOXOXXO
