<BR>To Kasooosh's 37th:
<BR>
<BR>To Katooosh this very day
<BR>A birthday is heading her way
<BR>
<BR>I can’t believe Katooosh is 37
<BR>For me every day with Katooosh is like being in heaven
<BR>
<BR>She is the best daughter, mom and wife
<BR>She is the pole of strength and happiness in everybody’s life
<BR>
<BR>This past year she got a sight called ksliterary.com
<BR>And in the swimming pool she swam
<BR>
<BR>This year she almost went to live in the holy land
<BR>Where she could play with a lot of sand
<BR>
<BR>Katooosh goes to Ultra-3
<BR>And she likes to eat crackers with brie
<BR>
<BR>Some people say my rhymes are dumb,
<BR>That they are just random thoughts that makes them numb)
<BR>
<BR>But Katooosh is always on my mind
<BR>Katooosh was the best in the world find
<BR>
<BR>So today is a day where celebrating Katooosh we do
<BR>She is so loved by a guy named after morning dew
<BR>
<BR>Katooosh is sometimes called Katie or Kate
<BR>A lot is determiend where you are in the state
<BR>
<BR>I must used have used ths rhymes about Katooosh
<BR>Who’s name also rhymes with Bush
<BR>
<BR>When Katooosh is 37 a lot will happen in our nation
<BR>Election, mortgage crisis and maybe even inflation
<BR>
<BR>So when Katooosh is 37 she thinks she’ll vote for Obama
<BR>and maybe she’ll even taste a shewarma
<BR>
<BR>Before that she used to like Macain
<BR>Because he was not part of the republican main
<BR>
<BR>Katooosh at 36 read tons of books
<BR>That complements her great looks
<BR>
<BR>And it is time to end this poem because Katooosh is 37 and more clever
<BR>I love you Katooosh, happy birthday – you are the best person ever
