<BR>Here is what appeared on my twitter:
<BR>Katooosh is 39 and even sweeter!

<BR>A book she is writing about old New York
<BR>And wine she drinks when I open the cork

<BR>She is just one year ahead of the big 4 – 0
<BR>And her beauty just continues to show

<BR>She has her gadgets her phone, her iTouch and,  if you count software, facebook
<BR>But what she doesn’t have is the Barnes and Noble Nook

<BR>Sending to Suffolk Y camp
<BR>And we will do it next year eve food stamp

<BR>Camping she will go later this summer in Yosemite for one day
<BR>But morning coffee she won’t get there on a tray

<BR>On weekends she goes to Atria on the Upper West Side
<BR>And if we are lucky one day this is where we will reside

<BR>Worried she got a little bit when the oil in the gulf started to spill into the coast
<BR>The people from BP she wanted to roast

<BR>And together we watch Friday Night Lights
<BR>And we do it without any fights


<BR>And on some night she like drinking Van gough in a glass
<BR>Isn’t it great that somebody is cutting our grass!  (And then sometimes I make a pass *blush*)


<BR>(There is more to this poem...but I can't find it yet)
