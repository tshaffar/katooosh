<BR>To Katooosh on 38(Incomplete):
 <BR>
<BR>Katooosh is now 38
<BR>And still Katooosh is first rate!
<BR>
<BR>From 37 to 38 you grew by 365 nights
<BR>And we canâ€™t even count those facebook bytes
<BR>
<BR>And then Katooosh discovered twitter
<BR>This makes Katooosh even sweeter
<BR>
<BR>This past year Katooosh went on  Nutra System diet
<BR>And she even stayed in a Hyatt
<BR>
<BR>And in the Summer Katooosh started swimming in the pool
<BR>And even showed many times in the shull
<BR>
<BR>Many miles she walked in Holtsville Park
<BR>And to the world you are so good even better then Noah and his arc
<BR>
<BR>And Katooosh got a new ipod
<BR>And that is very rad
<BR>
<BR>And then Katooosh loves her dvr
<BR>I wish I could put one in her car!
<BR>
<BR>So I wish you a lot of love and many many many more seasons
<BR>People love you for a lot of reasons
